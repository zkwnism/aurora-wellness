				<h2>What is Nutrition?</h2>
				<span class="byline">Nutrition is being divided into two. Macronutrient and micronutrient</span> </div>
			<p>As molecular biology, biochemistry, and genetics advance, nutrition has become more focused on metabolism and metabolic pathways - biochemical steps through which substances inside us are transformed from one form to another.
				Nutrition also focuses on how diseases, conditions, and problems can be prevented or reduced with a healthy diet.
				Similarly, nutrition involves identifying how certain diseases and conditions may be caused by dietary factors, such as poor diet (malnutrition), food allergies, and food intolerances.</p>
			<p><strong>Nutrition</strong> is the study of nutrients in food, how the body uses nutrients, and the relationship between diet, health, and disease.
				Major food manufacturers employ nutritionists and food scientists.
				Nutritionists may also work in journalism, education, and research. Many nutritionists work in the field of food science and technology.
				There is a lot of overlap between what nutritionists and dietitians do and study. Some nutritionists work in a healthcare setting, some dietitians work in the food industry, but a higher percentage of nutritionists
				 work in the food industry and in food science and technology, and a higher percentage of dietitians work in healthcare, corporate wellness, research, and education. </p>
