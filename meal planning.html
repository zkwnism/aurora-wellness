				<h2>Plan your meal properly</h2>
				<span class="byline">Before we go for the meal planning, let’s identify between what is meal planning and what is isn't.</span> </div>
			<p>Meal planning is asking the what’s for dinner question once for the whole week, instead of every night, and then shopping for and prepping the ingredients before cooking.</p>
      <img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Y7Q3KW3fCTI/maxresdefault.jpg" alt="Meal Planning" style="width:50%;height:50%;">
      <p>There are three simple way to approach a proper meal planning :</p>
  			<li>Select your dinners and their recipes, if needed. </li><br>
        <li>Shop for ingredients.</li><br>
        <li>Prepare those ingredients.</li><br>
      <p>You can choose what day to start your planning and we recommend Friday as a start.</p>

      <div class="title">
        <br><br><h2>These are not meal planning</h2>
      </div>

      <br><li><strong>A big tabbed binder with a full month of meals:</strong><br><br><p>
         Write it in your planner, on a paper you stick to the front of the fridge, in a Google doc, or on a whiteboard you hang <br>in the kitchen. Just put it somewhere you’re going to see it.</p></li>
      <br><li><strong>Entirely home cooked:</strong><br><br><p>
         We’re big, big fans of planning for takeout, pizza night, and leftovers.</p></li>
      <br><li><strong>Just for families of four: </strong><br><br><p>
        Meal planning is for everyone. But there are different strategies to employ depending on the number of people <br> you’re planning for. If you’re flying solo, these tips for meal planning for one are helpful.</p></li>
      <br><li><strong>Expensive :</strong><br><br><p>
        When this planning is done well, you will save your money in a lot ways.</p></li>
      <br><li><strong>A lot of work : </strong><br><br><p>
      Not true. You do a bit of concentrated work up front, but it’s smooth sailing once you begin to work your plan.</p></li>
      <br><li><strong>Inflexible : </strong><br><br><p>
      There’s so much room for experimentation, quick revisions, and customization in meal planning. It’s not set in stone.</p></li>

        <br><br><h2>Choose your recipes carefully</h2>
      </div>

      <p>Choosing recipes carefully is the most critical step since it sets this whole process in motion.
      But you shouldn’t really just choose a bunch of recipes and hope for the best. Start thinking about your meal plan at least three days before you want
      to proceed so you have a few days to go through the full process of making a shopping list, shopping, and then prepping.
      Here’s how we recommend you pick your recipes.</p>

      <img src="https://i.imgur.com/Cey1Ud1.jpg" alt="Imgur">

      <br><br><h2>Decide how many meals to plan for and what they need to do.</h2>
        <p>Have a look at your calendar for the coming week and decide the number of nights you want to make dinner at home.
          Five nights is the most common denominator, but for some people three nights is the sweet spot.
          Then you’ve got to hone in even further. </p>

      <h2>Where to Get Those Recipes</h2>
      <p>There are a few trusted websited that provides the best recipe for a healthy meal
        planning such as on Pinterest, Google search or cookbooks but here is one website that we recommended : </p>

      <h2>4 More Rules for Picking the Right Recipe</h2>
        <p><li>Choose meals that bless you with leftovers: They’re the gift that keeps on giving</li></p>
        <p><li>Cook recipes you know + one new recipe: This is a pro move! Assemble that master list of recipes you know by heart —
          the ones you make week after week and know your family loves.
           Then add one or two new recipes each week, but only if you want.</li></p>
        <p><li>Pick recipes based on common ingredients: This is another pro move and it starts with looking at what you already have in your fridge, freezer, and pantry.
          Shopping your home kitchen can help you decide on recipes and avoid wasted food. This is the money-saving aspect of meal planning in full effect.</li></p>
        <p><li>Cook things you really want to eat: You might have to spend some extra time uncovering recipes that are right for you, but it’s worth it if you still can’t wait to eat them.
          So, we’re saying the obvious on this one: Only cook things you want to eat!</li></p>

            <br><br><h2>Two Step Process for a Smarter Grocery List</h2>
          </div>

          <p>Okay, you’ve got your recipes.Now what do you need to make them? We recommend a two-step process of making an ingredient list and then a grocery list.
          This isn’t as tedious or time-sensitive as it sounds. In fact, go through the process once and you can pretty much consider yourself an expert.
        </p>

        <img src="https://kche.club/tmp/48/00/1vYVcmvlZcVgCi8ky0qPehwXQxaabz0x9VyUwe/photofreestocks-8290.jpg" alt="Nohat.me">

        <p><li><strong>Make a master ingredient list</strong></li></p>
          <p> This is not your grocery list, but it’s what leads to a really good one while also helping you take inventory of what’s in your kitchen.
            Start by going through each recipe’s ingredient list to make up the master list of things you’ll need for the week.
            Then, with keen eyes, go through your kitchen and cross off anything you already have. Now you’ve got a very accurate list you can turn into a grocery list.</p>

            <p><li><strong>Make the grocery list</strong></li></p>
              <p>Now, of course you could take your pared-down ingredient list to the grocery store and pick up everything you need without much hassle, but there’s still a better way!
                 For one, writing over the recipe is a nice double check on ingredients, but, beyond that, rewriting it lets you organize it for easier shopping.
                Begin by grouping ingredients together by departments in the grocery store.
                Take it a step further and put those sections in order of how you like to hit the store.
                A word to the wise: Leave the frozen section for the end, and swing by the meat department first if you want them to dice up meat for you or separate a package of chicken breast —
                 all things your grocery store butcher certainly can and will do.  </p>

              <p>You picked your recipe, you made a grocery list, you shopped for the meals, and now you’ve come to the point where the plan truly becomes dinner.
                But there’s one more step — and this one will help you beat cooking fatigue during the week.
                 You’ve got to do some prep! We recommend you set aside an hour on Sunday for batch cooking and chopping.
                 What you should do depends on the recipes for the week, but dicing up garlic, chopping veggies, washing lettuce and herbs, and even cooking up some
                  chicken thighs ahead of time is always a massive help.</p>

                  <div class="title">
                    <br><br><h2>Completed it already ? repeat !</h2>
                  </div>

                  <p>Meal planning is not difficult, but it’s not a walk in the park either — especially when you’re new to it.
                    So if you showed up here seeking to make your life in the kitchen a bit calmer because of it, you’re already well on your way.
                    Every time you go through the process of meal planning you learn what not to do, the places where to improve on next week, what you can skip, and how to customize the entire practice to fit your needs.
                     Continuing to do it only makes you better.</p>
